# Likelihood Function for Joint Statistical Measurement of the $H_0$ using GW and EM Observations #


## Abstract ## 
This [paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G2WzhXWwVUkQ5LdjVXmNFExEVrLKR_qi/view?usp=sharing) presents a methodology for measuring the Hubble constant
($H_0$) using joint observations of gravitational wave (GW) events and electromagnetic (EM) data from galaxy surveys. The likelihood function is
defined for both the GW and EM datasets, which include parameters such
as luminosity distance, sky positions, and redshifts. The joint likelihood
is obtained by taking the product of individual likelihoods since the data
generation processes are independent for each instrument. The methodology accounts for the uncertainty in host galaxy identification for the GW
event by marginalizing the choice of the galaxy with appropriate weights.
The authors discuss practical considerations, such as selection effects and
assumptions for the EM data, and present methods to handle cases with
complete or incomplete galaxy catalogs. The methodology allows for constraining H0 based on joint GW and EM observations and is adaptable
to various survey scenarios.
